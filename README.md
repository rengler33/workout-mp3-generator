# Workout mp3 generator

The goal of this project is to create simple mp3s (with no music) that dictate a list of exercises to perform and provide specified intervals of silence between exercises.

## Installation

Note: The `pydub` library requires ffmpeg to be installed.

On linux: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libavcodec-extra`
